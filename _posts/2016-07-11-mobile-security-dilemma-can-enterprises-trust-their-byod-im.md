  The modern enterprise requires high-performance mobility practices and tools
  in order to maintain a competitive edge. But these rely on usability, else
  they simply won't be adopted - and security, another of the enterprise's core
  requirements, is usability's most potent barrier. But by using data more
  intelligently and through prudent integrations, the two can actually co-exist,
  with neither compromised.
